							The focus of creating built environments without

							experts from within, and professionals in designing

							both engaging and understanding local knowledge
							among development practitioners, reaffirming the

							Bictro Institute prizes problem solving, creativity,
							entrepreneurship and adaptation to change. We will
							build on these core values and meet the challenges
							of the future by diversifying our student body and
							faculty; by giving our students, faculty, and staff
							an even greater appreciation for the importance of
							collaborating and sharing resources; and by
							promoting a culture that not only hires the best,
							but ensures that we develop and reward our top
							educators throughout their careers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Identifying, understanding, and ultimately solving
							the world’s major challenges requires that we bring
							together voices and ideas from a variety of
							perspectives and backgrounds. Bictro Institute is
							committed to increasing the pipeline and mentoring
							students from all backgrounds, particularly women
							for successful careers in all disciplines.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, we understand that we need to take care of
							those who will educate the next generation, both in
							the classroom and in the laboratory. That begins
							with hiring the best. It also means continuously
							re-examining the process by which we train and
							develop our educators — scholars and practitioners
							alike — to ensure that we will always meet our
							exacting standards for research and education.
